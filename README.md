# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

- Credit Hours: 3  
- Prerequisites: Data Structures and Algorithms  
- Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs):
- At the end of the course the students will be able to: 
1. Explain what is meant by "best", "expected", and "worst" case behavior of an algorithm  
2. Identify the characteristics of data and/or other conditions or assumptions that lead to different behaviors.
3. Determine informally the time and space complexity of simple algorithms
4. List and contrast standard complexity classes
5. Use big O, Omega, Theta notation formally to give asymptotic upper bounds on time and space complexity of algorithms  
6. Use of the strategies(brute-force, greedy, divide-andconquer, and dynamic programming) to solve an appropriate problem  
7. Solve problems using graph algorithms, including singlesource and all-pairs shortest paths, and at least one minimum spanning tree algorithm
8. Trace and/or implement a string-matching algorithm
